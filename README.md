🌱 AgriSense Morocco

AI-Powered Smart Agriculture Decision Support System

AgriSense Morocco is an interactive web application that uses environmental data and machine learning to support sustainable agricultural decision-making in Morocco. It helps farmers, students, and decision-makers identify suitable crops, irrigation needs, and climate risks through a simple visual dashboard.

🎯 Objectives

Support sustainable agriculture and food security

Use AI and environmental indicators to guide crop selection

Provide accessible decision support for non-technical users

Demonstrate real-world AI application in agriculture


🧠 How It Works

User selects a location in Morocco (map or coordinates)

Real-time weather data is fetched (temperature, humidity, rainfall)

Vegetation health is estimated using a simulated NDVI indicator

A machine-learning model analyzes the data


The app recommends:

Best-suited crop

Irrigation level

Risk awareness through visual indicators


🛠️ Technologies Used

Python 3.11

Streamlit – interactive web app

Scikit-learn – machine learning (Random Forest)

Pandas & NumPy – data processing

Plotly – interactive charts & maps

OpenWeatherMap API – real-time weather data

ReportLab – PDF export


📊 Features

Interactive map (Morocco-focused)

Real-time weather integration

AI-based crop and irrigation prediction

NDVI-based vegetation insight

What-if climate scenario analysis

Downloadable PDF report

Simple UI designed for accessibility


🌍 Sustainability & Food Security

AgriSense Morocco contributes to climate-smart agriculture, helping optimize resource use, reduce water waste, and improve crop resilience—supporting long-term sustainability and food security goals.
