🌱 GREENLIFE MOROCCO
Project: GreenLife – AI-Powered Smart Agriculture Decision Support System

GREENLIFE MOROCCO is an innovation-driven initiative focused on sustainability, climate action, and food security. Within this vision, AgriSense is an AI-powered decision support system designed to promote climate-smart agriculture in Morocco.

AgriSense is a web-based interactive application that leverages artificial intelligence, environmental indicators, and machine learning to support farmers, students, and decision-makers in making informed agricultural choices adapted to Morocco’s diverse climatic conditions.

Through a simple and visual dashboard, the platform provides insights on crop suitability, irrigation needs, and climate risks, making advanced decision-support tools accessible to non-technical users.

🎯 Objectives

Support sustainable agriculture and food security in Morocco

Optimize crop selection and irrigation using AI-driven insights

Assist farmers and stakeholders in adapting to climate variability

Bridge technology, agriculture, and environmental sustainability

Demonstrate real-world AI applications with social and environmental impact

🧠 How It Works

The user selects a location in Morocco (interactive map or coordinates)

The system retrieves real-time weather data (temperature, humidity, rainfall)

Vegetation health is assessed using a simulated NDVI indicator

A machine-learning model processes the environmental data

The platform then recommends:

🌾 Most suitable crops

💧 Optimal irrigation levels

⚠️ Climate and environmental risk indicators

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python 3.11

Streamlit – interactive web interface

Scikit-learn – machine learning (Random Forest)

Pandas & NumPy – data analysis and processing

Plotly – interactive visualizations and maps

OpenWeatherMap API – real-time climate data

ReportLab – PDF report generation

📊 Key Features

Morocco-focused interactive map

Real-time weather and climate data integration

AI-based crop and irrigation predictions

NDVI-based vegetation health analysis

Climate “what-if” scenario simulation

Downloadable decision-support PDF reports

Clean, accessible, and user-friendly interface

🌍 Sustainability & Impact

AgriSense reflects GREENLIFE MOROCCO’s commitment to sustainable development by promoting efficient water use, reducing agricultural risk, and strengthening crop resilience. The project contributes directly to climate-smart agriculture, environmental protection, and long-term food security in Morocco.
